## 3. Willingness to Pay

### Price Sensitivity Research

Based on comparable products and market data:

| Segment | Monthly Budget | Triggers Purchase |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Startup (10-25 ppl) | $0-200 | Free tier → paid for scaling |
| Growth (25-50 ppl) | $200-1,000 | Compliance demand, scaling pain |
| Enterprise (50+ ppl) | $1,000-5,000+ | Security audit, legal requirement |

### Competitive Benchmarks

- **GuardRails AI:** $499/mo (Pro), $2,500/mo (Enterprise)
- **Aporia:** $1,000+/mo (Enterprise only)
- **Honeybadger (LLM firewall):** $299/mo starting
- **Open Source alternatives:** Self-hosted, requires engineering time

### Recommended Pricing Strategy

**Entry Point:** Free tier (1,000 requests/month)  
**Growth Tier:** $49/mo (100k requests)  
**Pro Tier:** $199/mo (unlimited, priority support)  
**Enterprise:** Custom (on-premise, SLA, dedicated support)

**Willingness to Pay:** Target customers show **moderate willingness** - they'll pay for proven ROI but need clear value demonstration. Compliance-driven buyers are less price-sensitive.
